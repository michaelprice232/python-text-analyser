# python-text-analyser
Python script to calculate the total number of words and also the number of uses of supplied words (e.g. how many times does 'the' appear in the text)

I have used the following online repo for testing purposes which includes a number of online texts in the public domain:
http://www.gutenberg.org/

Usage:
Update the `books`, `directory_path` & `search_words_list` variables and then run as normal

Tested on Python 3+
